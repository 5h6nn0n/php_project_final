Here is a brief introduction to my php final project.

Project Summary: 

My project is an e-commerce platform that sells clothing items. Data associated with item 
inventory, users/customers, and order details are kept in a database to store, process, and access. 
It allows all casual users (registered and guest) to view items, add items to their cart, and place 
orders if at least one item is added to their cart and valid payment is provided. Their cart will be 
stored in a session. Items are sorted by category for convenient viewing. 

Registered users log in with an account using verifiable credentials, receive free membership 
shipping on all orders, and can view their personal order history. Registered users can also edit the 
information on their profile. Guest users only have permission to view items, add items to their cart, 
and place orders. Anyone who does not have a pre-existing account, guest or otherwise, can create one 
to become (and receive all the benefits of) a registered user. Administrators are given minimal 
restrictions in their ability to modify and maintain the database, having the full range of permissions 
for this project: select, update, insert. None of the users can delete anything from the database through 
this webapp because it is outside the scope for this project’s requirements. 


Test credentials:

Password => pa55word (works for all users in the database) 
Admin username => admin@myshop.com
Registered username => bobby@gmail.com (any of the users in the database are valid, 
		but, I usually sign in as bobby to test the registered user pages). 



Features I've considered to implement:

~ Back buttons for easy user navigation 
~ Session storage to save user progress 
~ Verification and confirmation messages 
~ Pass the primary keys as parameters 
~ Post method for personal information
~ The data in the SQL script is consistent 


Total number of webpages: 43
Total number of folders: 8
Completion date: Dec 1 2024

The official SQL script comes inside the php_project folder.

My ERD for the SQL script can be found inside the erd_webapp file.

The outline_of_contents file is something extra that I did for fun, in addition to the actual project. 
It kept everything organized during the planning phase. 

Overall Feedback Score: 180/180
